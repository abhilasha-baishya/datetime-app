Project Description

This project is a Date and Time Utility Application developed using Python and Streamlit. The main aim of this project is to provide multiple date and time related features in a single easy to use web application. Instead of running separate programs for each task this application combines everything into one interface.

The application allows the user to find the day of the week for any given date and also shows the current date and day. It includes a greeting system that changes based on the time of the day and wishes the user on their birthday if the date matches. Another feature of the project is the age calculator which calculates the user’s age in years months and days using the date of birth provided.

The project also includes a countdown timer which shows the remaining time for any future event entered by the user. This feature updates the remaining days hours minutes and seconds in real time. Streamlit is used to convert the normal Python program into a web application without using HTML or CSS. All user inputs are taken using interactive widgets and the output is displayed instantly on the screen.

This project helped in understanding Python date and time modules and also gave practical experience in building a simple web application. It shows how a console based program can be converted into an interactive app using Streamlit.
